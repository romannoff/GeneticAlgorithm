# GeneticAlgorithm
This module implements a genetic algorithm designed to solve optimization and modeling problems by sequentially selecting, combining, and varying desired parameters using mechanisms resembling biological evolution.

# Example
In the example file, it is proposed to solve an optimization problem in which three circles need to be placed in a square with a side equal to 1 so that the sum of their areas is the largest.

Important details:

* The best solution is not immediately available. It is often necessary to run the algorithm several times.

* There is basically a quasi-optimal solution that is close to optimal.

* The tolerance ratio is not checked (alpha = 0) due to the large population and the small size of the square
